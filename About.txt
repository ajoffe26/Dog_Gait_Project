The Dog Gait Project:

Senior Capstone of Andrew Joffe, Nate Swanson, and Damian Bianchi
Villanova University of Computer/Electrical Engineering 2025-2026

In this project we hope to build an e2e web app allowing users to 
input a video of a dog walking and for our ml algo to give a 
healthy v unhealthy diagnosis.

Thank you!
